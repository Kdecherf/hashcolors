What is it ?
-------------

Hashcolors is a tool to colorize hashes using ANSI colors.
It's inspired by bengl/node-hashcolors on GitHub.


Usage
-----

The tool currently supports MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512.
Usage: hashcolors hash arg1 [arg2 [arg3 [...]]]
  with hash is md5, sha1, sha256 or sha512
Aliases:
  md5colors arg1 [arg2 [arg3 [...]]]
  sha1colors arg1 [arg2 [arg3 [...]]]
  sha256colors arg1 [arg2 [arg3 [...]]]
  sha512colors arg1 [arg2 [arg3 [...]]]

If arg1 is a file, *colors will return its hash, else it will return the hash of the string.
